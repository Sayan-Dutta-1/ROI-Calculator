# ROI-Calculator---
 
 The purpose of my project is to provide a simple and user-friendly way for individuals to calculate the interest on their loans or investments. 
 By inputting the principal amount, interest rate, and time period, users can quickly and easily determine how much interest they will earn or owe. 
 This tool can be helpful for anyone who needs to calculate interest, such as students, investors, and business owners.
